# PEM encoded X.509 SSL/TLS certificate and private key.  By default, Debian
# installs a self-signed certificate.  This is useful for testing, but you
# should obtain a real certificate from a recognized certificate authority.
#
# These files are opened before dropping root privileges, so keep the key file
# unreadable by anyone but root. Included /usr/share/dovecot/mkcert.sh can be
# used to easily generate self-signed certificate, just make sure to update the
# domains in dovecot-openssl.cnf
#
# Preferred permissions: root:root 0444

# If key file is password protected, give the password here. Alternatively
# give it when starting dovecot with -p parameter. Since this file is often
# world-readable, you may want to place this setting instead to a different
# root owned 0600 file by using ssl_key_password = <path.
#ssl_server_key_password =

# PEM encoded trusted certificate authority. Set this only if you intend to use
# ssl_request_client_cert=yes. The file should contain the CA certificate(s)
# followed by the matching CRL(s). (e.g. ssl_server_ca_file = /etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem)
#ssl_ca =

# Require that CRL check succeeds for client certificates.
#ssl_require_crl = yes

# Request client to send a certificate. If you also want to require it, set
# auth_ssl_require_client_cert=yes in auth section.

# Which field from certificate to use for username. commonName and
# x500UniqueIdentifier are the usual choices. You'll also need to set
# auth_ssl_username_from_cert=yes.
#ssl_server_cert_username_field = commonName

# SSL protocols to use.  Debian systems specify TLSv1.2 by default, which should
# be reasonbly secure and compatible with existing clients.

# Minimum SSL protocol version to use. Potentially recognized values are SSLv3,
# TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, depending on the OpenSSL version used.

# Dovecot also recognizes values ANY and LATEST. ANY matches with any protocol
# version, and LATEST matches with the latest version supported by library.

# SSL ciphers to use
