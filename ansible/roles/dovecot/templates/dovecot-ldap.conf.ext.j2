# Use authentication binding for verifying password's validity. This works by
# logging into LDAP server using the username and password given by client.
# The pass_filter is used to find the DN for the user. Note that the pass_attrs
# is still used, only the password field is ignored in it. Before doing any
# search, the binding is switched back to the default DN.

# If authentication binding is used, you can save one LDAP request per login
# if users' DN can be specified with a common template. The template can use
# the standard %variables (see user_filter). Note that you can't
# use any pass_attrs if you use this setting.
#
# If you use this setting, it's a good idea to use a different
# dovecot-ldap.conf.ext for userdb (it can even be a symlink, just as long as
# the filename is different in userdb's args). That way one connection is used
# only for LDAP binds and another connection is used for user lookups.
# Otherwise the binding is changed to the default DN before each user lookup.
#
# For example:
#   auth_bind_userdn = cn=%u,ou=people,o=org
#
auth_bind_userdn = uid=%u,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=box,dc=pydis,dc=wtf

# There are also other special fields which can be returned, see
