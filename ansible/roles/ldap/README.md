# LDAP

This role prepares the environment for FreeIPA to be installed on our Rocky
Linux-based LDAP host.

Note that the actual installation process and subsequent setup steps from
`ipa-server-install` must unfortunately be performed manually, as the automation
of this process is not something that we have deemed critical to automate at
this stage.
