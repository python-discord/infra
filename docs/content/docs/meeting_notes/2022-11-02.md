# DevOps Meeting Notes

*Migrated from Notion*.

## Agenda

### Hanging behaviour of ModMail

- [Source](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/675756741417369640/1036720683067134052)
- Maybe use [Signals + a debugger](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25329467)?
- ... using [something like pdb for the
  debugger](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools)?
- Or [GDB, as it seems handy to poke at stuck multi-threaded python
  software](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DebuggingWithGdb)?

- ModMail has been upgraded to version 4
