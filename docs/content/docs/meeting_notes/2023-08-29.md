## Agenda

- **Bella is still on the streets**

  - The Python Discord Bella On The Streets Fundraising Campaign Q3 2023 has not
    been successful so far. To help Bella receive French citizenship, Joe has
    put up a French flag behind himself in the meeting.

    - Joe corrects my sarcasm. It is an Italian flag, not a French flag. The
      reason for this flag is that his new prime interest on campus was born in
      Italy.

- **The SnekBox CI build is pretty slow**

  - Guix and Nix are not alternatives. Neither is Ubuntu

  - We use pyenv to build multiple Python versions for a new feature

    - The feature is not rolled out yet

  - Part of the problem is that we build twice in the `build` and the `deploy`
    stage

  - On rollout, Joe tested it and it works fine

- No update on the Hugo build yet

- For snowflake, Johannes will write a proposal to the admins for hosting it

  - We should consider talking about the following points:

    - statistically ~8% of Tor traffic is problematic (10% of traffic is to
      hidden services, 80% of hidden service traffic is for illegal services)

    - overall the project's position and our ideal is to help people for a good
      cause

    - all traffic is forwarded to the Tor network, the service is lightweight
      and only proxies encrypted traffic there
