# DevOps Meeting Notes

*Migrated from Notion*.

## Agenda

*(This meeting was mostly about NetKube, with the following strange text
included, and everything outside of the text has been removed since the NetKube
plans have been scrapped)*.

Joe Banks, after a month-long hiatus to become a dad to every second girl on
uni campus, has managed to pull up to the DevOps meeting.

We are considering using Kubespray (https://kubespray.io/#/) in order to deploy
a production-ready bare-metal Kubernetes cluster without involvement from Joe
“Busy With Poly Girlfriend #20” Banks.

At the moment cluster networking is not working and Joe mentions that the last
time he has touched it, it worked perfectly fine. However, the last time he
touched it there was only 1 node, and therefore no inter-node communications.

Joe thinks he remembers installing 3 nodes, however, we at the DevOps team
believe this to be a marijuana dream
