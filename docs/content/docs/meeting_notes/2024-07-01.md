## Agenda

- **Resizing Netcup servers** (Joe, Johannes)

- **Updating the public statistics page** (Johannes)

  Discussing and showcasing possible alternatives to the current infrastructure
  powering https://stats.pythondiscord.com via the
  https://github.com/python-discord/public-stats repository.

- **New blog powered by Hugo** (Johannes)

  Our current Ghost-powered blog is a tiny bit strange, and the onboarding ramp
  to contribute articles is large. We want to migrate this to Hugo - Johannes is
  leading the effort on it. The main work will be building an appropriate theme,
  as no nicely suitable replacement theme has been found so far. Front-end
  contributors would be nice for this, although currently everything is still
  local on my machine.

- **Rethinking Bella: Suggested measures to gain autonomy** (Chris)

  Chris will present our current plans to biologically re-think and improve
  Bella's current architecture by means of hypertrophy-supported capillary
  enlargements, with the final goal of gaining complete control and ownership
  over the World Economic Forum by 2026. As Bella is currently on parental
  leave, we will send him the result of this voting via NNCP.
