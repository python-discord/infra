## Agenda

- No update on the Hugo build yet

- Johannes wrote a proposal for snowflake proxy to be deployed to our netcup hosts
  - Admins discussed and came to the conclusion that since we don't own the servers,
    we got the servers from netcup as a sponsorship to host our infra, so using them
    to host something that isn't our infra doesn't seem right.

- Lots of dependabot PRs closed
