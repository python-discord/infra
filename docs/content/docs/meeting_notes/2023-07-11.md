# DevOps Meeting Notes

## Participants

- Chris, Johannes, Bella, Bradley

## Agenda

### New Ansible setup

Chris presented the new Ansible setup he's been working on. We plan to use
WireGuard for networking. We agreed that selfhosting Kubernetes is not the way
to go. In general, the main benefit from switching away to Linode to Netcup is
going to be a ton more resources from the Netcup root servers we were given. The
original issue with Linode's AKS of constantly having problems with volumes has
not been present for a while. Chris mentions the one remaining issue is that
we're at half our memory capacity just at idle.

It's our decision where to go from here - we can stick to the Kubernetes setup
or decide on migrating to the Ansible setup. But we have bare metal access to
the Netcup hosts, which makes e.g. managing databases a lot easier. Chris
mentions the possibility to only use Netcup for our persistence and Linode AKS
for anything else, but this has the issue of us relying on two sponsors for our
infrastructure instead of one.

PostgreSQL was set up to run on ``lovelace``.

### Decision

**It was decided to hold a vote on the core development channel, which will be
evaluated next week to see how to proceed with the setup**.
