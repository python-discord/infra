# DevOps Meeting Notes

## Secret management improvements

To allow for **better management of our Kubernetes secrets**, Chris set out to
configure `git-crypt` in GPG key mode. For comparison, the previous approach was
that secrets were stored in Kubernetes only and had to be accessed via
`kubectl`, and now `git-crypt` allows us to transparently work with the files in
unencrypted manner locally, whilst having them secure on the remote, all via
`.gitattributes`.

The following people currently have access to this:

- Johannes Christ <jc@jchri.st> (`8C05D0E98B7914EDEBDCC8CC8E8E09282F2E17AF`)
- Chris Lovering <chris.lovering.95@gmail.com> (`1DA91E6CE87E3C1FCE32BC0CB6ED85CC5872D5E4`)
- Joe Banks <joe@jb3.dev> (`509CDFFC2D0783A33CF87D2B703EE21DE4D4D9C9`)

For Hassan, we are still waiting on response regarding his GPG key accuracy.

The pull request for the work can be found [at
python-discord/kubernetes#156](https://github.com/python-discord/kubernetes/pull/156).

**To have your key added, please contact any of the existing key holders**. More
documentation on this topic is pending to be written, see
[python-discord/kubernetes#157](https://github.com/python-discord/kubernetes/issues/157).


## Infrastructure migration decision

The voting started [last week](./2023-07-11.md) will be properly talked about
[next week](./2023-07-25.md), so far it looks like we're definitely not
selfhosting Kubernetes at the very least.
