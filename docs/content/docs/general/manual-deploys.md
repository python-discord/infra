# Manual Deployments

When the DevOps team are not available, Administrators and Core Developers can redeploy our critical services, such as Bot, Site and ModMail.

This is handled through workflow dispatches on this repository. To get started, head to the [Actions](https://github.com/python-discord/kubernetes/actions) tab of this repository and select `Manual Redeploy` in the sidebar, alternatively navigate [here](https://github.com/python-discord/kubernetes/actions/workflows/manual_redeploy.yml).

Click `Run workflow` on the right hand side and enter the service name that needs redeploying, keep the branch as `main`:

Click `Run` and refresh the page, you'll see a new in progress Action which you can track. Once the deployment completes notifications will be sent to the `#dev-ops` channel on Discord.

If you encounter errors with this please copy the Action run link to Discord so the DevOps team can investigate when available.
