# Upgrading PostgreSQL

## Step 1 - Enable maintenance mode

Add a worker route for `pythondiscord.com/*` to forward to the `maintenance` Cloudflare worker.

## Step 2 - Scale down all services that use PostgreSQL

Notably site, metricity, bitwarden and the like should be scaled down.

Services that are read only such as Grafana (but NOT Metabase, Metabase uses PostgreSQL for internal storage) do not need to be scaled down, as they do not update the database in any way.

```bash
$ kubectl scale deploy --replicas 0 site metricity metabase bitwarden ...
```

## Step 3 - Take a database dump and gzip

Using `pg_dumpall`, dump the contents of all databases to a `.sql` file.

Make sure to gzip for faster transfer.

Take a SHA512 sum of the output `.sql.gz` file to validate integrity after copying.

```bash
$ pg_dumpall -U pythondiscord > backup.sql
$ gzip backup.sql
$ sha512sum backup.sql

```

## Step 4 - Move database dump locally

Use `kubectl cp` to move the `backup.sql.gz` file from the remote pod to your local machine.

Validate the integrity of the received file.

## Step 5 - Attempt local import to new PostgreSQL version

Install the new version of PostgreSQL locally and import the data. Make sure you are operating on a **completely empty database server.**

```bash
$ gzcat backup.sql.gz | psql -U joe
```

You can use any PostgreSQL superuser for the import. Ensure that no errors other than those mentioned below occur, you may need to attempt multiple times to fix errors listed below.

### Handle import errors

Monitor the output of `psql` to check that no errors appear.

If you receive locale errors ensure that the locale your database is configured with matches the import script, this may require some usage of `sed`:

```bash
$ sed -i '' "s/en_US.utf8/en_GB.UTF-8/g" backup.sql
```

Ensure that you **RESET THESE CHANGES** before attempting an import on the remote, if they come from the PostgreSQL Docker image they will need the same locale as the export.

## Step 7 - Spin down PostgreSQL

Spin down PostgreSQL to 0 replicas.

## Step 8 - Take volume backup at Linode

Backup the volume at Linode through a clone in the Linode UI, name it something obvious.

## Step 9 - Remove the Linode persistent volume

Delete the volume specified in the `volume.yaml` file in the `postgresql` directory, you must delete the `pvc` first followed by the `pv`, you can find the relevant disks through `kubectl get pv/pvc`

## Step 10 - Create a new volume by re-applying the `volume.yaml` file

Apply the `volume.yaml` so a new, empty, volume is created.

## Step 11 - Bump the PostgreSQL version in the `deployment.yaml` file

Update the Docker image used in the deployment manifest.

## Step 12 - Apply the deployment

Run `kubectl apply -f postgresql/deployment.yaml` to start the new database server.

## Step 13 - Copy the data across

After the pod has initialised use `kubectl cp` to copy the gzipped backup to the new Postgres pod.

## Step 14 - Extract and import the new data

```bash
$ gunzip backup.sql.gz
$ psql -U pythondiscord -f backup.sql
```

## Step 15 - Validate data import complete

Ensure that all logs are successful, you may get duplicate errors for the `pythondiscord` user and database, these are safe to ignore.

## Step 16 - Scale up services

Restart the database server

```bash
$ kubectl scale deploy --replicas 1 metricity bitwarden metabase
```

## Step 17 - Validate all services interact correctly

Validate that all services reconnect successfully and start exchanging data, ensure that no abnormal logs are outputted and performance remains as expected.
