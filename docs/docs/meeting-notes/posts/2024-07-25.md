## Agenda

- **Open issues and pull requests in Joe's repositories**

  Joe has plenty of pending changes in his open source repositories on
  GitHub. Together with Chris, he went through these and reviewed them.
  Most were accepted. Fredrick proposed some further changes to the
  ff-bot merge routine which Joe will check out after the meeting.

- **LDAP**

  Bella is instructed to enter his street address into LDAP for t-shirt
  shipping.

- **New documentation**

  Johannes merged our new documentation. Unfortunately, he forgot to
  test it first. Joe visits it and discovers some problems. Johannes
  fixes it live.

- **Turing**

- **SMTP server**
