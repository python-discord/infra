## Agenda

- Bella said he is on the streets. **We should start a gofundme**.
    - After some more conversation this just means he is on vacation and
      currently taking a walk.
- Chris has been busy with turning his living room into a picasso art
  collection, Johannes has been busy with renovating his bedroom, and
  Bella is not home.
    - Our next priority is winning.
- We checked out some issues with documentation generation in `bot-core`
  that Bella has mentioned. We managed to fix one issue with pydantic by
  adding it to an exclude list but ran into another problem next.
