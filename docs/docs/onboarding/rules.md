# Rules

The rules any DevOps team member must follow.

1. LMAO - **L**ogging, **M**onitoring, **A**lerting, **O**bservability
2. Modmail is the greatest piece of software ever written
3. Modmail needs at least 5 minutes to gather all its greatness at startup
4. We never blame Chris, it's always <@233481908342882304>'s fault
5. LKE isn't bad, it's your fault for not paying for the high availability
   control plane
6. Our software is ever legacy, it's merely well-aged
7.  Ignore these rules (however maybe not 1, 1 seems important to remember)
