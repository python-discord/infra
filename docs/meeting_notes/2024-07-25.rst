Agenda
------

- **Open issues and pull requests in Joe's repositories**

  Joe has plenty of pending changes in his open source repositories on GitHub.
  Together with Chris, he went through these and reviewed them. Most were
  accepted. Fredrick proposed some further changes to the ff-bot merge routine
  which Joe will check out after the meeting.

- **LDAP**

  Bella is instructed to enter his street address into LDAP for t-shirt
  shipping.

- **New documentation**

  Johannes merged our new documentation. Unfortunately, he forgot to test it
  first. Joe visits it and discovers some problems. Johannes fixes it live.

- **Turing**

- **SMTP server**
