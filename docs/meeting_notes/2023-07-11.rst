New Ansible setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chris presented the new Ansible setup he’s been working on. We plan to
use WireGuard for networking. We agreed that selfhosting Kubernetes is
not the way to go. In general, the main benefit from switching away to
Linode to Netcup is going to be a ton more resources from the Netcup
root servers we were given. The original issue with Linode’s AKS of
constantly having problems with volumes has not been present for a
while. Chris mentions the one remaining issue is that we’re at half our
memory capacity just at idle.

It’s our decision where to go from here - we can stick to the Kubernetes
setup or decide on migrating to the Ansible setup. But we have bare
metal access to the Netcup hosts, which makes e.g. managing databases a
lot easier. Chris mentions the possibility to only use Netcup for our
persistence and Linode AKS for anything else, but this has the issue of
us relying on two sponsors for our infrastructure instead of one.

PostgreSQL was set up to run on ``lovelace``.

Decision

**It was decided to hold a vote on the core development channel, which
will be evaluated next week to see how to proceed with the setup**.
