# DevOps Meeting Notes

*Migrated from Notion*.

## Agenda

- One hour of gartic phone, for team spirit.
- Created user accounts for Sofi and Hassan
- Joe created an architecture diagram of the NGINX setup
  - _This is still in Notion_
- Joe explained his NGINX plans:
  > “It’s not actually that hard, right? So you spawn 5 instances of nginx in a
  > DaemonSet, because then one gets deployed to every node okay, following?
  > Then we get NodePort, instead of LoadBalancers or whatever, which will get
  > a random port allocatead in the 35000 range, and that will go to nginx, and
  > on each of those ports, it will go to nginx, right? And then we poll the
  > Kubernetes API and what is the port that each of these nginx instances is
  > running on, and add that into a roundrobin on the fifth node. Right? Yeah.
  > That’s correct. That won’t do TLS though, so that will just HAProxy. Yeah.”
- Joe will terminate our JumpCloud account
- Chris reset the Minecraft server
- Email alerting needs to be configured
