*Migrated from Notion*.

Agenda
------

*(This meeting was mostly about NetKube, with the following strange text
included, and everything outside of the text has been removed since the
NetKube plans have been scrapped)*.

Joe Banks, after a month-long hiatus to become a dad to every second
girl on uni campus, has managed to pull up to the DevOps meeting.

We are considering using Kubespray (https://kubespray.io/#/) in order to
deploy a production-ready bare-metal Kubernetes cluster without
involvement from Joe “Busy With Poly Girlfriend #20” Banks.

At the moment cluster networking is not working and Joe mentions that
the last time he has touched it, it worked perfectly fine. However, the
last time he touched it there was only 1 node, and therefore no
inter-node communications.

Joe thinks he remembers installing 3 nodes, however, we at the DevOps
team believe this to be a marijuana dream
