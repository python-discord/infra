## Agenda

- Bella said he is on the streets. **We should start a gofundme**.

  - After some more conversation this just means he is on vacation and currently
    taking a walk.

- Chris has been busy with turning his living room into a picasso art
  collection, Johannes has been busy with renovating his bedroom, and Bella is
  not home.

  - Our next priority is winning.

- We checked out some issues with documentation generation in `bot-core` that
  Bella has mentioned. We managed to fix one issue with pydantic by adding it to
  an exclude list but ran into another problem next.
