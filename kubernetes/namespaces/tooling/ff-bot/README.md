# Fast-Forward Bot

We deploy an instance of [ff_bot](https://github.com/jb3/ff_bot) to aid in
repository management.

See the documentation of the `ff_bot` project for information on deployment and
usage, but it boils down to authorised users (dictated by the repository policy
file) running `/merge` and the bot running a fast-forward merge.
